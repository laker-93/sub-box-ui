                <p>Subbox is a music management and streaming service. Upload your music collection to subbox and it will automatically organise your songs, fetching album art and correcting any misnamed track information. You can then choose to download your updated and organised collection or use subbox to stream your music. Giving you complete control over your own music collection.</p>
                <p>Subbox also provides additional features for DJs, allowing you to import and export your music collection from various DJ software providers.</p>
                <p>
                    Subbox uses a modified version of Feishin, an open source and modern music player that provides an excellent UI.
                    Once SubBox is set up, your music will be streamable with a UI that looks like this:
                </p>
                <img src="/imgs/player-screenshot" width="604" height="448">
                <p>In order to use subbox you will first need to create an account. Sign up using the button in the top right.</p>
                <p>Once you have created an account, you will be able to listen to some default music added to your collection.</p>
                <p>To upload more music to your account, there are two stages to complete.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><a href="/upload">Upload</a> your music files (if you are looking to upload from your DJ software, go to the DJ page <a href="/djs">here</a>).</li>
                    <img src="/imgs/upload" width="604" height="448">
                  <li>Once you have uploaded the music files, <a href="/process">process</a> your uploaded tracks. This will cause subbox to process your music tracks, fetch meta information for the tracks, such as album art and lyrics, so that this information appears in the music player.</li>
                    <img src="/imgs/process" width="604" height="448">
                </ol>
                <p>Once your tracks are uploaded and processed by subbox, you can stream them <a href="/listen">here</a>.</p>
                <img src="/imgs/listen" width="604" height="448">
                <p>To add more music to your collection, repeat steps 1 and 2.</p>
                <p>If you're interested in exporting your subbox collection to your DJ controller, go to the DJ page <a href="/djs">here</a>.</p>
