            <p>Subbox allows you to convert to and from your DJ software collection to sub box.</p>
            <p>This means you can stream, edit and organise your collection on the go using sub box and then convert your updates in to the format required for your DJ controller.</p>
            <p>To begin you can export your collection from your DJ software and upload to subbox so you can start streaming it.</p>
            <p>Import from your DJ software <a href="djs-import">here</a>. </p>
            <p>Once you have imported your DJ collection, you can stream it <a href="listen">here</a>. You can then make changes to your collection as you listen, for example rating tracks and organising them in to playlists. Then when you want to export the updates to your DJ software go <a href="djs-export">here</a>.</p>
